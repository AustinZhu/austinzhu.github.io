## Solution

Let's solve it in a greedy approach. We can simply select the columns that make the array sorted.

```haskell
delCol :: [String] -> [String] -> [String]
delCol arr tmp
  | null (head arr) = tmp
  | otherwise = delCol (map (drop 1) arr) $ if sorted trial then trial else tmp
 where
  sorted xs = and $ zipWith (<=) xs (tail xs)
  trial = zipWith (++) tmp $ map (take 1) arr

sortByDelCol :: [String] -> Int
sortByDelCol []  = 0
sortByDelCol [x] = 0
sortByDelCol arr = diffLen arr $ delCol arr [ "" | x <- arr ]
  where diffLen = (-) `on` (length . head)
```

Here, `tmp` is used to store our selection of columns and `trial` is the next column to be selected. Since we want our list to be sorted in lexicographic order, we take the next columns if these columns are sorted, otherwise we just move on to the next iteration.

## Complexity Analysis

Let $$m$$ be the number of elements in the array and $$n$$ be the number of characters in each element.

Making a trial takes $$O(mn)$$ because both `zipWith` and `map` take linear time. Moreover, we are iterating over the length of the element $$n$$ in the array. Thus, the overall time complexity is $$O(mn^2)$$.

The space complexity is simply $$O(mn)$$.
