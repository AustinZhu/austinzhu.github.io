>> Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you canâ€™t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so f*** off.

## Solution

```haskell
data Tree a = Node a (Tree a) (Tree a) | EmptyNode

invert :: Tree a -> Tree a
invert EmptyNode = EmptyNode
invert (Node val left right) = Node val (invert right) (invert left)
```

3 simple steps to solve this:

1. Get an opportunity to be interviewed onsite at Google (99% completed)
2. Swap the left subtree and right subtree (99.5% completed)
3. Call `invert` on their subtrees (100% completed)

Excellent! Now you are qualified for an engineer position at Google! (XD

Don't worry if you stuck on step 2 and 3, ~~you can still get hired by Apple!~~
