> Given the root of a binary tree, then value `v` and depth `d`, you need to add a row of nodes with value `v` at the given depth `d`. The root node is at depth 1.
>
> The adding rule is: given a positive integer depth `d`, for each NOT null tree nodes `N` in depth `d-1`, create two tree nodes with value `v` as `N's` left subtree root and right subtree root. And `N's` **original left subtree** should be the left subtree of the new left subtree root, its **original right subtree** should be the right subtree of the new right subtree root. If depth `d` is 1 that means there is no depth d-1 at all, then create a tree node with value **v** as the new root of the whole original tree, and the original tree is the new root's left subtree.

## Solution

This is a insertion only with different rules. Here we need to consider three cases:

1. If we arrive at the depth `d` we insert two nodes with value `v` as the left and right node of the current node.
2. If the current node has a left subtree and a right subtree, then we perform a recursive call on its left subtree and right subtree
3. If the current node only has a left subtree(or a right subtree) the we perform a recursive call on it left(right) subtree and leave the other side empty.

```haskell
data BTree = Node Int BTree BTree | EmptyTree deriving (Show, Eq, Read)

addRow :: BTree -> Int -> Int -> BTree
addRow (Node i left right) v d | (d - 1) == 1 =
                                   Node i (Node v left EmptyTree) (Node v EmptyTree right)
                               | left /= EmptyTree && right /= EmptyTree =
                                   Node i (addRow left v (d - 1)) (addRow right v (d-1))
                               | left /= EmptyTree =
                                   Node i (addRow left v (d - 1)) right
                               | right /= EmptyTree =
                                   Node i left (addRow right v (d - 1))
```

## Complexity Analysis

The worst time complexity and space complexity are both $$O(n)$$ if we want to insert the value as the deepest row in the tree.
